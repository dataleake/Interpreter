## Interpreter

The goal of this project is to take a data set and perform some type of model fitting to it based on arguments. 

The function will take the data, fit a model, then navigated by the user, will return an explanation of the specified output.

For example, when the user wants to see the residuals;
  
  **Input**: Number denoting residuals
  
  **Output**: The residuals are representative of each data points vertical distance from the model.
          The value of the residual denotes whether the point lies above or below the expected value based on the model.
          (Show all residuals from model) -- Perhaps show RSS, RSE, plot of the residuals? --
